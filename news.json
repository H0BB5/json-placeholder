      "summary": "The week of volatility has seen volatility in the markets, with inflation exceeding expectations for the third consecutive month in March, leading investors to lower expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East fueled a surge in commodities like oil and gold. Major banks surpassed forecasts despite slightly exceeding their forecasts. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked the most in over a year due to rising indications of an imminent Iranian attack on Israeli soil. The likelihood of a June rate cut dropped from 60% to 20%, and some Wall Street analysts now expect only one rate cut in December. The rise in mortgage rates has raised affordability concerns for homebuyers, exacerbating the housing market's challenges with high prices and low inventory. The confidence in Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk is also decreasing due to his focus on other ventures, while Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. praised for its strong long-term performance. By 2030, artificial intelligence technologies could account for up to 25% of U.S. energy consumption, according to Arm Holdings CEO Rene Haas, highlighting the significant increase in electricity demand driven by advanced AI models.",

Despite central bank buying continuing to drive the gold price, there are indications of a shift from institutional and retail investors that could significantly increase the value of the precious metal. Major buyers include China, which bought over 12 tonnes in February, the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Qatar, Turkey, and Mauritania. However, this represents a slowdown of the trend of the last two years. Data for gold ETF flows indicates a shift in the last few weeks, but it is too soon to say there has been a clear reversal. The article also notes that the economy is not as strong as it would appear, with consumer debt levels and unemployment figures at over 1.5 million.",

The Israeli Minister of National Security has met with top officials to prepare for a potential strike. The White House confirmed that Iran's threats to Israel were \"real and credible,\" while the Foreign Office of the UK has warned its citizens against traveling to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory due to the possibility of an attack from Iran.
